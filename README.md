# AcreetionOS Browser
Brought to you by the AcreetionOS Team.

Are you wondering why we decided to make a web browser? Well, Firefox can't be trusted anymore, and LibreWolf has gone woke. So, we just kind of had too.

# We do this out of necessity.

If it weren't for LibreWolf going woke/politically-motivated, and Firefox taking telemetry data, we wouldn't be doing this. But here we are. We are working on a Firefox-based, Librewolf-based browser without politics, or data collection from upstream organizations.

We make the promise that we are not going to take data from you, UNLESS YOU KNOW, which means you can connect to the internet in a secure and non-worrying way.

I'm sick and tired of politics, so leave at the door this repository, as any political/woke contributions will be rejected.
